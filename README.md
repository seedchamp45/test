# test
instruction

1.input data by typing "func testInput(first:Int, second: Int, condition: String)"
1.1 initialize N K by declare condition = "assignNK"
1.2 initialize A_N B_N by type first = numbers in range of 1-8, second = numbers in range of 1-8 declare condition = "continue"
1.3 finish operation by type first = 0, second = 0 and declare condition = "end"
2.get result by declare variable = showResult()

//example
testInput(first: 16, second: 1000000000, condition: "assignNK")
testInput(first: 1, second: 3, condition: "continue")
testInput(first: 6, second: 8, condition: "continue")
testInput(first: 3, second: 5, condition: "continue")
testInput(first: 2, second: 6, condition: "continue")
testInput(first: 3, second: 7, condition: "continue")
testInput(first: 3, second: 4, condition: "continue")
testInput(first: 4, second: 7, condition: "continue")
testInput(first: 2, second: 4, condition: "continue")
testInput(first: 1, second: 3, condition: "continue")
testInput(first: 2, second: 7, condition: "continue")
testInput(first: 2, second: 7, condition: "continue")
testInput(first: 2, second: 4, condition: "continue")
testInput(first: 6, second: 7, condition: "continue")
testInput(first: 1, second: 7, condition: "continue")
testInput(first: 3, second: 4, condition: "continue")
